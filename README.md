**Recognize and define problem situation:**

**Ayesha must find someway to remind her husband to take his medicines on time.**

**Identify alternatives:**
Set up smartphone reminders: Ayesha could schedule daily reminders on her husband's smartphone to alert him when it's time to take his medicine.
Use a pill organizer: Ayesha could organize her husband's medications in a pill organizer with compartments for each day of the week, making it easier for him to see if he's taken his medication.
Post-it notes: Ayesha could place brightly colored Post-it notes in prominent places around the house, such as on the bathroom mirror or the fridge, as visual reminders for her husband to take his medicine.
Alarm clock: Ayesha could set up an alarm clock in the house to ring at specific times when her husband needs to take his medication.
Enlist family support: Ayesha could involve other family members, such as children or siblings, to remind her husband to take his medicine when she's not around.

**Evaluate alternatives:**
Smartphone reminders: Pros include convenience and reliability. Cons may include reliance on technology and potential for the husband to ignore or forget the notifications.
Pill organizer: Pros include organization and visual cues. Cons may include the possibility of the husband forgetting to check the organizer.
Post-it notes: Pros include simplicity and visibility. Cons may include the husband becoming accustomed to the notes and ignoring them over time.
Alarm clock: Pros include auditory cues and flexibility in placement. Cons may include the husband becoming desensitized to the alarm or finding it disruptive.
Enlist family support: Pros include shared responsibility and varied reminders. Cons may include inconsistency in reminders if family members are not always present.

**Select alternative:**
Considering the pros and cons of each option, Ayesha might decide to combine several methods for a comprehensive approach. For example, she could use a combination of smartphone reminders, a pill organizer, and Post-it notes to ensure her husband receives timely reminders from different sources.

**Implement alternative:**
Ayesha can start by setting up the smartphone reminders, filling the pill organizer for the week, and placing Post-it notes in strategic locations around the house. She can also communicate with her family members to involve them in the reminder system.

**Follow up and evaluate results:**
Ayesha should monitor her husband's adherence to the medication schedule and adjust the reminder system as needed based on his feedback and any observed challenges. Regular check-ins and open communication will help ensure the effectiveness of the chosen method.
